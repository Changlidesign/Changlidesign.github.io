<h1>My Poster Design: The Monster World</h1>
<p>The Monster World is package design of candy. Firstly,I designed six little monsters, they are live in people's feet and human can not see them. Although they never can be found, they still very happy every day and have their special world.The monster world means maybe everyone in the world is a "monster",but you have your own friends who stay with you. You also can be happy.</p>
