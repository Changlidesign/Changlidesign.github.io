    <h2>Charles Robert Leslie RA (19 October 1794-5 May 
1859)</h2>
    <p class="one">Leslie was born in London to American parents. When he was five years of age he 
returned with them to the United States, where they settled in Philadelphia. Leslie 
completedhis education and afterwards became apprenticed to a bookseller. He was, 
however, mainly interested in painting and drama, and when George Frederick Cooke 
visited the city he executed a portrait of the actor from recollection of him on the stage, 
which was considered a work of such promise that a fund was raised to enable the young 
artist to study in Europe.</p>
<p class="two">He left for London in 1811, bearing introductions which procured for him the friendship 
of West, Beechey, Allston, Coleridge and Washington Irving, being admitted as a student 
of the Royal Academy, where he carried off two silver medals. At first, influenced by West 
and Fuseli, he essayed high art, and his earliest importantsubject depicted Saul and the 
Witch of Endor; but he soon discovered his true aptitude and became a painter of cabinet-
pictures, dealing, not like those of David Wilkie, with the contemporary life that surrounded
him, but with scenes from the great masters of fiction, from Shakespeare and Cervantes, 
Addison and Moliere, Swift, Sterne, Fielding and Smollett. </p>
