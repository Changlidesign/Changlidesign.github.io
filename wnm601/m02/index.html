<h2>Shakespeare's Contemporaries</h2>
<h3>1. Christopher Marlowe</h3>
<p class="italic">The brilliant young playwright Christopher Marlowe was killed in a tavern brawl on May 30, 1593, and the events surrounding his suspicious death have chilled and captivated all those interested in Renaissance England. Known as Shakespeare's only literary peer1 until his untimely death, Marlowe is responsible for some of the finest lyrical poetry of any age, and possibly had a hand in writing four of Shakespeare's early dramas.2 

Allusions to Marlowe's work are prevalent in Shakespeare's plays. Here Shakespeare quotes directly a line from Marlowe's Hero and Leander (176): "Whoever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?" (As You Like It, 3.5.81). It is argued that Shakespeare alludes to Marlowe's murder in As You Like It, 3.3.11-12: "it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room", and apostrophizes his dead friend in A Midsummer Night's Dream:
The lunatic, the lover and the poet 
Are of imagination all compact: 
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic, 
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt: 
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, 
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth 
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen 
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing 
A local habitation and a name. (5.1.8-18)
Now, for those with lots of imagination: theory has it that, because he was about to be tried for heresy, Marlowe staged his death and fled to Italy. From there, Marlowe is supposed to have penned all the works attributed to Shakespeare and had them smuggled back to England.</p>
<h3>2.King James I</h3>
<p class="normal">After the death of Elizabeth I, James the VI of Scotland became the new ruler, known in England as King James I. His fascination with the occult prompted him to write his own treatise on witchcraft, Daemonology, and many believe that James's vehement belief in the divine right of kings influenced Shakespeare's play-writing methodology. James I is probably best known for his translation of the Bible into English which became known as the Authorized King James Version. For more please see King James I: Shakespeare's Patron.</p>
<h3>3.Tragedies</h3>
<h4>Antony and Cleopatra (1607-1608)</h4>
<p class="normal">The story of Mark Antony, Roman military leader and triumvir, who is madly in love with Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. 
Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).</p>
<h4>Coriolanus (1607-1608)</h4>
<p class="normal">The last of Shakespeare's great political tragedies, chronicling the life of the mighty warrior Caius Marcius Coriolanus. 
Earliest known text: First Folio (1623).</p>
<h4>Hamlet (1600-1601)</h4>
<p class="normal">Since its first recorded production, Hamlet has engrossed playgoers, thrilled readers, and challenged actors more so than any other play in the Western canon. No other single work of fiction has produced more commonly used expressions. Earliest known text: Quarto (1603).</p>
<h1>Shakespeare's quotes(2)</h1>
<ol>
  <li>"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."(Twelfth Night Act 2, Scene 5)</li>
  <li>"Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once."(Julius Caesar Act 2, Scene 2)</li>
  <li>"Full fathom five thy father lies, of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade, but doth suffer a sea-change into something rich and strange."(The Tempest Act 1, Scene 2)</li>
  <li>"A man can die but once."(Henry IV, Part 2 Act 3, Part 2)</li>
  <li>"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!"(King Lear Act 1, Scene 4)</li>

<h2>Shakespeare's plays</h2>
<p class="ex">The plays written by English poet, playwright, and actor William Shakespeare have the reputation of being among the greatest in the English language and in Western literature. Traditionally, the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy, history, and comedy; they have been translated into every major living language, in addition to being continually performed all around the world.
Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous First Folio was published. The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio. However, modern criticism has labelled some of these plays "problem plays" that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies.
When Shakespeare first arrived in London in the late 1570s or early 1580s, dramatists writing for London's new commercial playhouses (such as The Curtain) were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively Elizabethan synthesis. Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the Tudor morality plays. These plays, celebrating piety generally, use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over Evil. The characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. As a child, Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play (along with, perhaps, mystery plays and miracle plays).
The other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as Roman closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.</p2>
